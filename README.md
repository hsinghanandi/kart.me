# kart.me

Kart.me is an e-commerce application, where users can place their orders based on the list of available products. 

This application uses a third-party API, called FakeStoreAPI, which is free and serves as Data Source for my platform. Here is it documentation for FakeStoreAPI, https://fakestoreapi.com/docs

Kart.me has been developed using MERN stack.

## Features of Kart.me

1. Variety of products to choose from
2. Filter products based on preferences
3. A simple, intuitive & user-guided UI
4. Effortless shopping experience

# Getting Started

The final project has been divided into two parts, one serves the Client functionality and the other handles the Server functionality

`kart.me-FE` is the Client-side of the application, and `kart.me-BE` is the Server-side.

The installation instructions for both could be found in their respective `readme` file.

# How To Use Kart.me

Kart.me is really simple to use. Users can order their favourite products in just 3 simple steps!

1. Choose from the list of different products. Use filter, if necessary.
2. Hit CART icon at the top-right, to see the list of added products, and click Checkout.
3. Provide and verify your address details and place order. Done!

NOTE: To remove a product while at checkout, user need to navigate to homepage to do it. This is due to the limited scope of this application set for now, so I've focused on a forward flow to the application. I'll refine its functionality in the V2 of Kart.me :smile:






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
